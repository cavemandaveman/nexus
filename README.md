# nexus

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/clearent/nexus.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/clearent/nexus "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

A Dockerfile for Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3, based on Alpine.

To run, binding the exposed port 8081 to the host.

```
$ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus cavemandaveman/nexus
```


## Notes

*   Default credentials are: `admin` / `admin123`

*   It can take some time (2-3 minutes) for the service to launch in a
new container.  You can tail the log to determine once Nexus is ready:

```
$ docker logs -f nexus
```

*   Installation of Nexus is to `/opt/sonatype/nexus`.  

*   A persistent directory, `/nexus-data`, is used for configuration,
logs, and storage.

*   Two environment variables can be used to control the JVM arguments

    *   `JAVA_MAX_MEM`, passed as -Xmx.  Defaults to `1200m`.

    *   `JAVA_MIN_MEM`, passed as -Xms.  Defaults to `1200m`.

    These can be used supplied at runtime to control the JVM:

    ```
    $ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus -e JAVA_MAX_MEM=2048M cavemandaveman/nexus
    ```

*   As of version 3.4.0, Sonatype [recommends](https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006448847#filehandles) increasing the system file descriptor limit. In order to do this in Docker, you need to first make sure that the Docker daemon is configured with a ulimit >= 65536 in the systemd/upstart/daemon.json configuration. You may then include the ulimit on the container run command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --ulimit nofile=65536 --name nexus cavemandaveman/nexus
```


### SSL

If you want to run Nexus in SSL, you need to create a Java keystore file with your certificate. See the [Jetty documentation](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html) for help.

You will need to mount your keystore to the appropriate directory and pass in the keystore password as well.

```
$ docker run -d -p 8443:8443 --name nexus -v /path/to/your-keystore.jks:/nexus-data/keystore.jks -e JKS_PASSWORD="changeit" cavemandaveman/nexus
```

Nexus will now serve its' UI on HTTPS on port 8443 and redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.

If you are going to run a Docker registry inside of Nexus, you will need to route to internal port 5000 as well.

```
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -p 8443:8443 --name nexus -v /path/to/your-keystore.jks:/nexus-data/keystore.jks -e JKS_PASSWORD="changeit" cavemandaveman/nexus
```


### Persistent Data

There are two general approaches to handling persistent storage requirements
with Docker. See [Managing Data in Containers](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/)
for additional information.

1.  *Use a data volume container*.  Since data volumes are persistent
    until no containers use them, a container can created specifically for
    this purpose.  This is the recommended approach.  

    ```
    $ docker run -d --name nexus-data cavemandaveman/nexus echo "data-only container for Nexus"
    $ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus --volumes-from nexus-data cavemandaveman/nexus
    ```

2.  *Mount a host directory as the volume*.

    ```
    $ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus -v /some/dir/nexus-data:/nexus-data cavemandaveman/nexus
    ```

## Build and publish

Use attached docker compose file:

`docker-compose build`

or

`docker-compose publish`

If you want to play around just hit

`docker-compose up`
